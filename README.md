# Digital Design Lab - Georgia Tech

This repo contains the various labs from the digital design lab class at GeorgiaTech. It contains design implementations in the form of Quartus Block Diagrams, VHDL code and Assemble asm files.

The experiments/labs are as follows:

Lab 1: Intro to Quartus and Functional/Timing Simulations

Lab 2: Circuit Implementation of SOP expressions and Oscilloscope simulations.

Lab 3: Tristate Circuits, Period of Vout and Positive Duty Cycles.

Lab 4: SOP implementations with D Flip Flops and Oscilloscope experiments.

Lab 5: VHDL design implementation, Logic Analyzer simulations of SOP expression.

Lab 6: Train controller for virtual, intersecting train tracks.

Lab 7: Basic Implementation of the Simple Computer (SCOMP).

Lab 8: Advanced SCOMP.
